## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the **corrosion inhibition efficiency** of an extract derived from **Ewedu (Corchorus olitorius)** on **copper** samples immersed in **nitric acid** over different **time intervals**. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the inhibitor in reducing weight loss and corrosion.

## ðŸ§ª **Key Features**
- **Data Input and Preparation**:
  - Reads experimental data from Excel or CSV files.
  - Processes data into Python dictionaries for flexible manipulation.

- **Data Filtering and Analysis**:
  - Filters data based on **Time of Study (hrs)** and **Inhibitor Concentration**.
  - Analyzes key metrics like **Weight Loss** and **Inhibitor Efficiency**.

- **Visualization**:
  - Generates line plots to visualize:
    - **Weight Loss vs. Inhibitor Concentration**.
    - **Inhibitor Efficiency vs. Inhibitor Concentration**.
    - **Average Weight Loss over Time**.

- **General-Purpose Code**:
  - Flexible code structure to handle different datasets and time intervals.
